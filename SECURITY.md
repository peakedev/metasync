# Version Support & Security Policy

We only provide security fixes, patches, and maintenance updates for releases **≥ 1.0.0**.  
Any version **< 1.0.0 is unsupported** and receives **no security updates**.

## Scope

- Issues related to versions below 1.0.0 will not be investigated.
- Security advisories, CVE responses, and dependency updates apply only to supported versions (≥ 1.0.0).
- Users must upgrade to a supported release before requesting security assistance.

## Rationale

Pre-1.0.0 versions were early development iterations and do not meet the stability or security guarantees of the maintained release line.

## Required Action

Upgrade to any version **≥ 1.0.0** to receive security coverage.
